# CC98-autosignin

Very simple tool to sign in CC98 in ZJU

## Usage

```shell
python main.py
```

and enter your CC98 username and password if you are the first time to use.

Thanks to @eWloYW8 for the module `ZJUWebVPN`, which really saves me a lot of time.

But remember to update this module to the latest version. I mean, the version in this repo, not the latest release. A small bug was caught when I view the code today, only for the 10 yuan VPN user (e.g. me).
